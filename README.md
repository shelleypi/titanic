# Predicting Titanic Passenger Survival Using Multiple ML Models

In this project, we'll create different machine learning models that predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems that some groups of people were more likely to survive than others. Our goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether or not a passenger aboard the Titanic survived, using passenger data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview). 

### Summary of Results
The best model we created was a Linear Regression model with an accuracy of 0.79485.
